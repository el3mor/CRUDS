# CRUDS Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete and Search. These operations are fundamental to working with databases and are commonly used in software development. 

## Create

The Create operation involves adding new data to a database. It typically requires specifying the data fields and their values. This operation is used when you want to insert new records into a database table.

## Read

The Read operation is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to query the database and retrieve specific records or all records that match certain criteria. This operation is commonly used to display data to users or perform calculations based on the retrieved data.

## Update

The Update operation is used to modify existing data in a database. It allows you to change the values of specific fields in one or more records. This operation is useful when you need to update information or correct errors in the database.

## Delete

The Delete operation is used to remove data from a database. It allows you to delete specific records or all records that match certain criteria. This operation is commonly used when you want to remove outdated or unnecessary data from the database.

CRUD operations are essential for managing data in applications and are supported by most database management systems. They provide a standardized way to interact with databases and ensure data integrity and consistency.
## Search

The Search operation is used to find specific data within a database. It allows you to query the database and retrieve records that match certain search criteria. This operation is commonly used when you want to locate specific information or perform advanced searches based on specific conditions.

The Search operation typically involves specifying search parameters, such as keywords, filters, or conditions, to narrow down the search results. It can be used to search for data in one or more fields, and it may support various search operators, such as exact match, partial match, or fuzzy search.

The Search operation is crucial for applications that require data retrieval based on specific user queries or search functionality. It enables users to find relevant information quickly and efficiently, improving the overall user experience.

In summary, the Search operation complements the CRUD operations by providing a way to locate and retrieve specific data within a database based on user-defined search criteria.
